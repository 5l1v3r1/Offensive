## Vulnerable

### http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/495022

> Versions Affected:
> Tomcat 4.1.0 to 4.1.37
> Tomcat 5.5.0 to 5.5.26
> Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.16

> When using a RequestDispatcher the target path was normalised before the query string was removed. A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to access content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint or by locating it in under the WEB-INF directory.

## Fixed

Fixed [with](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/container/branches/tc4.1.x/catalina/src/share/org/apache/catalina/core/ApplicationContext.java?r1=680950&r2=680949&pathrev=680950&diff_format=f) normalization only on the path, not on the full URI
