## Vulnerable

### http://osdir.com/ml/bugtraq.security/2014-03/msg00067.html
> Versions Affected:
> - - Spring MVC 3.0.0 to 3.2.8
> - - Spring MVC 4.0.0 to 4.0.1
> - - Earlier unsupported versions may be affected
> Description:
> When a programmer does not specify the action on the Spring form, Spring automatically populates the action field with the requested uri. An atacker can use this to inject malicious content into the form.

### https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-2645

> During our security audit (with Paros and others), it turned out that when someone requests a page with a form with an url like `http://somedomain.com/myform.html?id=123&someparam="><script>alert('XSS!')</script>` , the page is vulnerable to an XSS attack, since there is a javascript popup in the browser.
> This could be exploited by a malicious website linking to this page and asking a user to give his credit card (by manipulating the html DOM with a more advanced javascript), fooling the user that he is on a legitimite website.
> Solution: The FormTag appends the querystring in FormTag#resolveAction().
> The resolveAction() method should at least html escape '<' and '>', since escaping all characters may give unwanted results. Our temporary solution is explicitly specifiying an "action" attribute in the tag.> 

### https://vuldb.com/?id.66721

> A vulnerability has been found in Springsource Spring Framework and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown function. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability. As an impact it is known to affect integrity.
> The weakness was released 03/20/2014. The advisory is shared for download at jira.springsource.org. This vulnerability is known as CVE-2014-1904. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploitation doesn't need any form of authentication. Neither technical details nor an exploit are publicly available.

### Explaining
The requestUri is not encoded thus vulnerable, it is instantiated by [`resolveAction()`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/741b4b229ae032bd17175b46f98673ce0bd2d485/spring-webmvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/servlet/tags/form/FormTag.java#L430) method which return it.
`resolveAction()` is then invoked in [`writeTagContent()`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/741b4b229ae032bd17175b46f98673ce0bd2d485/spring-webmvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/servlet/tags/form/FormTag.java#L345) with

```java
tagWriter.writeAttribute(ACTION_ATTRIBUTE, resolveAction());
```

the tag is eventually [closed and asked to render](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/bc14c5ba83e1f211628456bbccce7b2531aac58c/spring-webmvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/servlet/tags/form/FormTag.java#L483)

```java
this.tagWriter.endTag();
return EVAL_PAGE;
```

## Fixed

Fixed [with](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/741b4b229ae032bd17175b46f98673ce0bd2d485) 

```java
String requestUri = getRequestContext().getRequestUri(); // Before there was only this line

// Added to fix the vuln
String encoding = pageContext.getResponse().getCharacterEncoding();
try {
	requestUri = UriUtils.encodePath(requestUri, encoding);
}
catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
	throw new JspException(e);
}
```

### How to exploit

We must find a webpage which contains a form without an action, then we must ask to someone to visit it (better if the admin site)

```html
<form /*action="demo_form.asp"*/ method="get">
  First name: <input type="text" name="fname"><br>
  Last name: <input type="text" name="lname"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

The action is then wrongly populated with the URI loaded (the one in the address bar), but the URI loaded contains HTML and has a tag with some Javascript inside which will be executed. We can steal all session's cookies and load an iframe pointing to our ekit which will infect the victim. With the stolen cookies we can log as administrator in the website and modify each page of the website to silently point to our ekit.
